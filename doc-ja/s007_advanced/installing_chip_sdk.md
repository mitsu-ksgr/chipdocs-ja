## Installing C.H.I.P. SDK
CHIP-SDK has everything needed to develop software for C.H.I.P. Most importantly, if you want to load an operating system onto CHIP, the only supported way is to do this from a virtual machine. Given that the virtual machine runs Ubuntu, it's pretty safe to say that Ubuntu users can flash without the virtual machine.

### Requirements
* Computer running OS X 10.10+, Ubuntu 14.04+, or Windows 7+
* At least 1 GB free RAM, up to 40 GB of disk space may be used
* Software: VirtualBox, Vagrant, git, terminal

### Software Setup
There are several required software pieces to get the CHIP SDK virtual machine running.

#### Install VirtualBox and Extensions
* Get the installer for [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install the Oracle VM VirtualBox [Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* If you are using Windows, you need to add the VirtualBox installation directory to your PATH.
* In case of an Ubuntu host: add your user to the vboxusers group!

#### Install Vagrant
Install Vagrant from the [Vagrant site.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
Alternatively, if OS X, you can use the [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager:
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
brew cask install vagrant

#### Install Git
Installation of Git depends on your operating system:

* Windows: [direct to download](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Debian Linux: `sudo apt-get install git`
* OS X homebrew: `brew install git`

### Clone the CHIP-SDK repository and boot the Virtual Machine
Assuming you have [git in your PATH](http://www.chambaud.com/2013/07/08/adding-git-to-path-when-using-github-for-windows/), open up a terminal and type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-SDK
```

and start up the virtual machine:

```shell
cd CHIP-SDK
vagrant up
```

### Login To Virtual Machine
In the same shell on the host type the following:

```shell
 vagrant ssh
```
If everything went well you should see the following prompt:

```shell
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:~$
```

#### All The Commands At Once
Here's all the commands in one place:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-SDK
cd CHIP-SDK
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Congratulations! Now you're ready to Flash a C.H.I.P. from your SDK!

### Troubleshooting
Here are a few possible problems.

#### Shared Folder Out of Sync
In case you run into trouble because the kernel in the VM was updated and the shared vagrant folder can no longer be mounted, update the guest additions by typing the following in the CHIP-SDK directory on the host:

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

This [blog post](http://kvz.io/blog/2013/01/16/vagrant-tip-keep-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-sync/) has some more tips on keeping additions in sync.

#### Invalid State
If you get an error like:

```shell
error: The guest machine entered an invalid state while waiting for it to boot.
```

This probably means your version of VirtualBox needs updating and/or needs the Extension Pack. Update as necessary and try `vagrant up` again.

#### Couldn't Find File
If you get the error:

```shell
error: Couldn't open file /Volumes/Satellite/gitbins/CHIP-SDK/base
```

that means you didn't cd CHIP-SDK. Very basic, perhaps, but late nights sometimes need that bump!

### Updating the CHIP-SDK Virtual Machine
You may have been working with CHIP for a while now, and you want to updated your SDK. It's only slightly more involved than sync'ing with the git repo; you have to update the virtual machine, too.

#### Requirements
  * Computer running OS X 10.10+, Ubuntu 14.04+, or Windows 7+
  * Existing [installation of CHIP-SDK](#installing-c-h-i-p-sdk)

#### How To Update
Just follow these steps:

On your host operating system, pull the latest changes from our Git repository:

```shell
  cd ~/CHIP-SDK
  git pull
```

Make sure the virtual machine is shut down and update it:

```shell
  vagrant halt
  vagrant provision
```

Now you can boot the virtual machine and ssh into it:

```shell
  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh
```

Once you see the trusty prompt, your CHIP SDK virtual machine is ready to use:

```shell
  vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:~$
```
#### All The Commands At Once
Here's all the commands in one place:

```shell
  cd ~/CHIP-SDK
  git pull
  vagrant halt
  vagrant provision
  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh
```
