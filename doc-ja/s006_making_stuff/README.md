CHIP is more than cool, small, inexpensive computer. It's a complete system for building projects that require remote control, network connectivity, and physical interfacing with people and the environment.
CHIP's pin headers have all the connections to make this happen. An annotated diagram of the pin headers can be found in the [hardware section](#pin-headers) of this manual.
