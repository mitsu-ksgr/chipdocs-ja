## Uninstall Software
You can use the Synaptic Package manager to uninstall any packages you no longer need.
If you know the name, you can use the Search function to find the package, then Mark it for Removal.

For example, if you want to remove AbiWord, first open Synaptic and search for "**abiword**":
