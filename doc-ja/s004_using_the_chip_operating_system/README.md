# Using The CHIP Operating System
If you've used a desktop or laptop computer before, the CHIP Operating System should be pretty familiar. There are menus, icons to click, menus with more stuff when you right-click, keyboard shortcuts, applications to run, and settings to set. CHIP is small, so we keep our operating system simple. Almost everything can be accessed from the **Computer Things** menu: settings, launching apps, and access to files. There's also a few convenient functions in the top right **system tray.**
