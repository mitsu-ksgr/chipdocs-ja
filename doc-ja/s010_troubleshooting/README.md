# Troubleshooting

## CHIP Won't Boot or Startup

***Problem:*** I attached a keyboard, monitor, and powered CHIP, but it does not do anything. The LEDs are on, but I can't do anything with CHIP!

***Fixes:*** The initial batch of CHIPs shipped with a problem in their NAND flash storage. Don't worry, this is a software issue, and we've built a repair tool.

  * Download the repair tool.
  * Double-click on the repair tool icon.
  * Follow the onscreen messages to complete the repair process.

## Sudden Shutdown (Brown-out)
***Problem:*** I attached a mouse and keyboard, and my CHIP suddenly turned off.

***Fixes:*** Like most tiny computers, the USB port on CHIP provides a limited amount of power. When you plug in a keyboard and an optical mouse, for example, they will draw too much current from CHIP, not leaving enough for the processor. As a result, CHIP will immediately shut down. There are a few ways to avoid this. 

  *  Use a [powered USB hub](#powered-usb-hub)
  *  Use a [bluetooth keyboard and mouse](#bluetooth-keyboard-and-mouse). Yes, this is a very specific solution, but a good one when you are only using the USB port for keyboard and mouse. Keeps your desk cleaner too!
  *  Execute the command `sudo axp209 --no_limit` in the terminal before you attach your USB peripherals.
  *  Provide power from a supply connecting ground and 5V the pins [headers 1 and 2 on U13](#pin-headers).

***Problem:*** My CHIP booted fine until it got to loading the desktop GUI, then it shut down.

***Fixes:*** This is usually the result of an underpowered power supply. We recommend a 5V power supply with a minimum 1A current rating. 

  *  You can find the current rating on your power supply's "Output" - it should read *1000 mA* or *1A* (or a higher number). You may need a magnifying glass to read it, but they all should have this info on the label!
  *  Instead of powering CHIP using the microUSB port, try using the [header pins](#pin-headers) CHG-IN (U13-2) and GND (U13-1). 
  *  Add a [LiPo battery](#power-from-a-battery). This provides enough extra current and power buffer to prevent this problem. 

## No Video Output
Problem: Monitor is attached, but there is no video on my monitor

Fixes: There are a few possible problems here

  *  **wrong TRRS arrangement**: try different ends of your cable. Make sure is subscribes to [this use of the tip, rings, and sleeve](#about-the-trrs-connector)
  *  **PAL monitor**: CHIP outputs NTSC format video by default. You can change this, however, by following [this guide](#ntsc-or-pal).
  *  **Video trace cut for mic in**: This is pretty unlikely, but if you are working with a used CHIP, it may be that the tip connector has been switched to [work as a microphone input](#microphone-and-audio-input). Before you do fix this with a bit of solder, take a close look at your board to see if there is evidence of a score mark indicating the cut trace.
