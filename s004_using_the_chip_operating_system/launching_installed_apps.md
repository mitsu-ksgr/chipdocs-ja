## Launching Installed Apps
CHIP comes prepackaged with many open-source applications to get you started. It's easy to launch an application. 
You can select an application from the "Computer Things!" menu and select an app from the categories:

Or, for more control, launch the Application Finder in Accessories, where you can use the search bar and easily navigate among the categories:

### Ice Weasel Browser
Ice Weasel is a Debian Linux version of the Firefox browser. The browser is largely the same as Firefox, just with a different name. More information is at the [Debian website](https://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel) and in this [stack exchange thread](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44215/is-there-any-advantage-of-using-iceweasel-and-firefox).

### Video Player
CHIP plays video! Use the built-in Mplayer to open and play videos.

### Terminal (commandline)
The life blood of linux. If there's something you can't do on the desktop, or you want to automate tasks, or access different hardware settings using nothing but a keyboard and text, you'll open up Terminal.
